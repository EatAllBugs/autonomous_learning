# Project 2 - Traffic Sign Classification

The goal of this project was  to build a **CNN** in [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to **classify traffic sign images** from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

Main steps covered in this lab are:
- dataset exploration and visualization
- data augmentation
- deep network design and training 
- visualization of the certainty/uncertainty of the model's predictions
