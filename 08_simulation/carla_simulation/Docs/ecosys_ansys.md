# Ansys Real Time Radar Model: Training a Vehicle Longitudinal Controller Using Reinforcement Learning

In a webinair series in April 2021, [Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/) presented the details of their integration of the Ansys Real Time Radar (RTR) with the CARLA simulator. Here you can download and view the presentation slides and videos that accompanied the webinair. 

The presentation details how the RTR was integrated with CARLA to train a vehicle longitudinal controller using reinforcement learning and includes the model, action space and reward policy used. The videos show the results of the training in the CARLA simulator.
