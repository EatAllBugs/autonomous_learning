# Recorder  

This feature allows to record and reenact a previous simulation. All the events happened are registered in the [recorder file](ref_recorder_binary_file_format.md). There are some high-level queries to trace and study those events.

## Recording

All the data is written in a binary file on the server side only. However, the recorder is managed using the [carla.Client](python_api.md#carla.Client).  

Actors are updated on every frame according to the data contained in the recorded file. Actors in the current simulation that appear in the recording will be either moved or re-spawned to emulate it. Those that do not appear in the recording will continue their way as if nothing happened.  

!!! Important
    By the end of the playback, vehicles will be set to autopilot, but __pedestrians will stop__. 

The recorder file includes information regarding many different elements.  

*   __Actors__ — creation and destruction, bounding and trigger boxes.  
*   __Traffic lights__ — state changes and time settings.  
*   __Vehicles__ — position and orientation, linear and angular velocity, light state, and physics control.  
*   __Pedestrians__ — position and orientation, and linear and angular velocity.  
*   __Lights__ — Light states from buildings, streets, and vehicles.

To start recording there is only need for a file name. Using `\`, `/` or `:` characters in the file name will define it as an absolute path. If no path is detailed, the file will be saved in `CarlaUE4/Saved`.  

```py
client.start_recorder("/home/carla/recording01.log")
```

By default, the recorder is set to store only the necessary information to play the simulation back. In order to save all the information previously mentioned, the argument `additional_data` has to be configured when starting the recording.  

```py
client.start_recorder("/home/carla/recording01.log", True)
```

!!! Note
    Additional data includes: linear and angular velocity of vehicles and pedestrians, traffic light time settings, execution time, actors' trigger and bounding boxes, and physics controls for vehicles.  

To stop the recording, the call is also straightforward.

```py
client.stop_recorder()
```

!!! Note
    As an estimate, 1h recording with 50 traffic lights and 100 vehicles takes around 200MB in size.

## Simulation playback

A playback can be started at any point during a simulation. Besides the path to the log file, this method needs some parameters.

```py
client.replay_file("recording01.log", start, duration, camera)
```

| Parameter                                                                                                                        | Description                                                                                                                      | Notes                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`                                                                                                                          | Recording time in seconds to start the simulation at.                                                                            | If positive, time will be considered from the beginning of the recording. <br> If negative, it will be considered from the end. |
| `duration`                                                                                                                       | Seconds to playback. 0 is all the recording.                                                                                     | By the end of the playback, vehicles will be set to autopilot and pedestrians will stop.                                         |
| `camera`                                                                                                                         | ID of the actor that the camera will focus on.                                                                                   | Set it to `0` to let the spectator move freely.                                                                                  |

<br>



### Setting a time factor

The time factor will determine the playback speed. It can be changed any moment without stopping the playback.

```py
client.set_replayer_time_factor(2.0)
```

| Parameter     | Default       | Fast motion   | Slow motion   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `time_factor` | **1\.0**      | **\>1.0**     | ** <1.0 **    |

<br>



!!! Important
    If `time_factor>2.0`, the actors' position interpolation is disabled and just updated. Pedestrians' animations are not affected by the time factor.  

When the time factor is around __20x__ traffic flow is easily appreciated.

## Recorded file

The details of a recording can be retrieved using a simple API call. By default, it only retrieves those frames where an event was registered. Setting the parameter `show_all` would return all the information for every frame. The specifics on how the data is stored are detailed in the [recorder's reference](ref_recorder_binary_file_format.md).  

```py
# Show info for relevant frames
print(client.show_recorder_file_info("recording01.log"))
``` 

* __Opening information.__ Map, date and time when the simulation was recorded.  

* __Frame information.__ Any event that could happen such as actors spawning or collisions. It contains the actors' ID and some additional information.  

* __Closing information.__ Number of frames and total time recorded.  

```

## Queries

### Collisions

Vehicles must have a [collision detector](ref_sensors.md#collision-detector) attached to record collisions. These can be queried, using arguments to filter the type of the actors involved in the collisions. For example, `h` identifies actors whose `role_name = hero`, usually assigned to vehicles managed by the user. There is a specific set of actor types available for the query. 

* __h__ = Hero  
* __v__ = Vehicle  
* __w__ = Walker  
* __t__ = Traffic light  
* __o__ = Other  
* __a__ = Any  

!!! Note
    The `manual_control.py` script assigns `role_name = hero` for the ego vehicle.  

The collision query requires two flags to filter the collisions. The following example would show collisions between vehicles, and any other object.  

```py
print(client.show_recorder_collisions("recording01.log", "v", "a"))
```

The output summarizes time of the collision, and type, ID and description of the actors involved.  

```
Version: 1
Map: Town05
Date: 02/19/19 15:36:08

    Time  Types     Id Actor 1                                 Id Actor 2
      16   v v     122 vehicle.yamaha.yzf                     118 vehicle.dodge_charger.police
      27   v o     122 vehicle.yamaha.yzf                       0

Frames: 790
Duration: 46 seconds
```

!!! Important
    As it is the `hero` or `ego` vehicle who registers the collision, this will always be `Actor 1`. 


The collision can be reenacted by using the recorder and setting it seconds before the event.

```py
client.replay_file("col2.log", 13, 0, 122)
```
In this case, the playback showed this.

### Blocked actors

Detects vehicles that where stucked during the recording. An actor is considered blocked if it does not move a minimum distance in a certain time. This definition is made by the user during the query.

```py
print(client.show_recorder_actors_blocked("recording01.log", min_time, min_distance))
```

| Parameter                                                 | Description                                               | Default                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `min_time`                                                | Minimum seconds to move \`min\_distance\`.                | 30secs.                                                   |
| `min_distance`                                            | Minimum centimeters to move to not be considered blocked. | 10cm.                                                     |



---

!!! Note
    Sometimes vehicles are stopped at traffic lights for longer than expected.  

The following example considers that vehicles are blocked when moving less than 1 meter during 60 seconds.

```py
client.show_recorder_actors_blocked("col3.log", 60, 100)
```

The output is sorted by __duration__, which states how long it took to stop being "blocked" and move the `min_distance`.

```
Version: 1
Map: Town05
Date: 02/19/19 15:45:01

    Time     Id Actor                                 Duration
      36    173 vehicle.nissan.patrol                      336
      75    214 vehicle.chevrolet.impala                   295
     302    143 vehicle.bmw.grandtourer                     67

Frames: 6985
Duration: 374 seconds
```

The vehicle `173` was stopped for `336` seconds at time `36` seconds. Reenact the simulation a few seconds before the second `36` to check it out.

```py
client.replay_file("col3.log", 34, 0, 173)
```
